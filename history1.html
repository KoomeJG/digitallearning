     <h2>The meaning of history</h2> 

     	<p>
		History is an account of events  that took place in the past.<br>
		It may also be defined as a branch of knowledge which deals with past events of human beings and their response to their environment over the years.<br>
		Therefore, history is the endless story of mankind’s actions and events affecting him in the past.<br>
		Pre-history (unwritten) history. Refers to those activities that human engaged in before writing and drawing were invented .
		<br>		
		Such knowledge is reconstructed through songs, myths, stories, artefacts, fossils and language of the people.<br>
		</p>
     </div>
	 
	

     <div id="topic12">
	  <h2>Branches of history </h2> 
	 
	 <p>
	 <span><b>Social history</b></span>- deals with the traditions, values and cultural practises of the people.<br>
		<span><b>Economic history</b></span>- refers to the means of livelihood of people, such as hunting, gathering, agriculture and trade.<br>
		<span><b>Political history</b></span> -deals with control systems in society for example maintenance of law and order, leadership and security.<br>

	 
	 </p>     	
     </div>
	 
	 <div id="topic13">
     <h2>The meaning of Government </h2> 

     	<p>
		The term government is derived from the verb to govern which means to exercise authority over, to rule or control.<br> 
		Therefore, it means a group of people within a state or country given authority to organise direct and control the affairs of the state or country.<br>
		In Kenya the government has three arms.<br>
		<h3>The legislature/ parliament.</h3>
		<p>
		It includes the national assembly, the senate and the president there work is to make laws.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Executive.</h3>
		<p>
		Includes the president, the cabinet and the civil service, it implements the law.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Judiciary (courts).</h3>
		<p>
		Its responsibility is to see to that the laws made are constitutional, 
		that they are followed and that those who break them are punished.<br>
		</p>
	 
		</p>
     </div>
	 
	 <div id="topic14">
     <h2>Forms of Government </h2> 
	 <h3>Democratic</h3>
	 <p>
	 This type of government requires the rulers to regularly seek public mandate through popular vote.<br>
	 These governments are based on the promise that elections are free and fair and that the elected officials represent the wishes and aspiration of the people.<br>
		Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people, for the people and by the people’’.<br>
		In a democratic government, freedoms and rights are provided for in the constitution that governs the law of the nation.<br> 
		It is there freedoms that enable discussions and debate on matters of national importance.<br>

	 </p>
	 <h3>Aristocratic, etymology</h3>
	 <p>
	 Greek words `aristos’ meaning best and `kratos’ meaning power.<br>
	 Therefore, it’s a type of government in which a group of people from the highest social class that is the loyalty, in a society rule over others.<br>
	 The king or queen is the head of the government while senior positions in the government are given to the privileged members
	 from among the nobles who are considered superior because of the wealthy family background they are born into and their superior education.<br>
	 </p>
	 <h3>Monarchical</h3>
	 <p>
	 Is a form of government where democracy is practised but aristocratic power is respected.<br>
		Parliament is the supreme organ but the monarchy-the royalty that are in power- be it a king or queen is retained as traditional and respected as head of state.<br>
		a)	Absolute monarchy- refers to the unrestricted power of the head of state. The monarchy is dictatorial.<br>
		b)	Constitutional monarchy- restricted monarchical power is determined by what is spelt out in the constitution E.G Britain and Lesotho.<br>

	 </p>
	 <h3>Dictatorial</h3>
	 <p>
	 
	 Is a system of government where the ruler has total powers over his subjects.<br>
	 Dictators are the sole authority where they rule.<br>
	 They make law and execute justice; they exercise their rule forcefully, suppressing their subjects at will.<br>
	 They curtail the freedom of the subjects.<br>

     <h2>Importance of studying history </h2> 

     	<p>
		
		<li>It helps us to know the origin of mankind, his development and progress he has made to this date.</li>
		<li>It helps us appreciate man achievements and learn from the failures of the past so as to manage the present better.</li>
		<li>It helps man to understand how to relate and depend on each other. Decisions taken by one person affects others.</li>

		<li>It helps one to be more knowledgeable as its documents information of varied importance to human development.</li>
		<li>It helps man to know the time, place and space of past events.</li>
		<li>We utilize historical records of events such as famine; clashes and civil wars to prepare people cope with and avoid a repeat of such tragedies.</li>
		<li>It develops a critical mind as we try to explain historical events by asking questions of WHY, HOW and WHEN.</li>
		<li>History provides intellectual fulfilment to the learner.</li>
		<li>History influences career choice.</li>

     <h2>Importance of studying Government </h2> 

     	<p>
		<ul>
		<li>It helps us to understand how laws are made.</li>
		<li>We also learn how development programme are formulated and implemented.</li>
		<li>We learn how powers vested in different organs of the government i.e. legislature, judiciary and executive are exercised.</li>
		<li>Through the study of government we understand and appreciate the need for a government.</li>
		<li>It helps us appreciate the constitution and the powers of making and reviewing laws and states.</li>
		<li>The study of government makes us know our role as citizens and roles of leaders who govern us. This makes us law abiding and productive.</li>
		<li>Government is a social contract and hence helps us understand our rights, responsibilities as well as limitations within which we must operate and protect us from dictatorship.</li>
		<li>The study of government just like history influences career choice.</li>

     <h2>Sources of history and Government </h2> 

     	<p>
		They are divided into.</br>
		<ul>
		<li>Unwritten sources.</li>
		<li>Written sources. </li>
		<li>Electronic source.</li>
		</ul>
	 
		</p>
     </div>
	 
	 <div id="topic18">
     <h2>unwritten sources </h2> 

		<p>
	 Refers to historical information which is not recorded in writing.<br>
	 They are oral traditions, linguistics (language), anthropology (culture), archaeology, palaeontology and genetics.<br>
	 
	 <h3>a)Oral traditions</h3> 
	 Refers to the practice of handing down historical information by word of mouth from one generation to the next.<br>
	 It includes folktales, proverbs, songs and stories.<br>
	 <h3><i>Advantages of Oral traditions</i></h3>
	 <ul>
	 <li>It is important in the study of pre-history.</li>
	 <li>They integrate the study of history with other social studies.</li>
	 <li>It is cheap.</li>
	 <li>It compliments other sources of history</li>
	 </ul>
	 
	 
	 <h3><i>Limitations of Oral traditions</i></h3>
	 <ul>
	 <li>The information may be exaggerated as it’s difficult to distinguish between what was real from what was imagined.</li>
	 <li>The information may be forgotten or omitted because it depends on human memory.</li>
	 <li>Information may deliberately conceal some important information. People tend to talk more of their successes than their failures.</li>
	 <li>It may not provide dates and give correct chronology of events because it depends on human memory.</li>
	 <li>It is an expensive method of gathering information as one has to pay for the information’s transportation, lunch and accommodation.</li>
	 <li>Its time consuming, one requires a lot of time to interview one individual.</li>
	 <li>The information may be biased.</li>
	 
	 </ul>
	 <h3>b) Linguistics</h3>
	 <p>
	 Refers to the scientific study of language.<br> 
	 <b>Historical linguistics</b> is the study of language as it changes in the course of time.<br> 
	 It traces the principles of language change and establishes the current genealogical classification of a particular language.<br>
	 The study of a language helps in discovering its content, form and vocabulary.<br>
	 It can tell us the historical experience of the people who speak it.<br>
	 People who speak related language may be assumed to have a common origin, be connected or had been in close contact sometimes backing in the past.<br> 
	 </p>
		</p>
	 <h3><i>Advantages of linguistics</i></h3>
	<ul>
	<li>It’s time consuming as it takes long to study a particular language.</li>
	<li>When translating the language, the historian might omit some words, in the process; vital information about people’s history may be lost.</li>
	<li>Different languages may have similar words with different meanings, this can confuse a researcher.</li>
	<li>There has been borrowing of words from other languages and this has interfered with or corrupted the parent language this leads to inaccurate information.</li>
	<li>A linguist may find some of the words from different groups difficult to understand.</li>
	<li>Some languages have become archaic or extinct and are therefore difficult to translate.</li>
	</ul>
		<h3>c)	Anthropology</h3>
		<p>
		Is the study of human beings, their origin, development, beliefs and social relationships.<br>
		To carry out their work, anthropologists have to live among the people to experience their way of life.<br>
		This helps them to understand and explain structures of societies, forms of social organization, institutions, marriage, and forms of government, systems of inheritance, religious customs and cultural values.<br> 
		They can also explain aspects of the economic such as fishing and agriculture in which a given community depends.<br>
		Anthropology is vital because it gives a deeper understanding of particular aspects of people’s culture.<br>
		</p>
		<h3><i>Advantages of Antropology</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>It enables historians to determine the cultural past of a community.</li>
		<li>Information is easily obtained from the surrounding.</li>
		<li>It compliments other sources.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><i>Limitations of Antropology</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>It’s expensive because it involves living among the people you are studying or observing.</li>
		<li>It’s time consuming method of acquiring information.</li>
		<li>The researcher may find it difficult to adapt fully to the environmental during their research, and if they do, they face the risk of losing their own culture.</li>
		<li>People under study may try to behave differently when the researcher is around, it is hence unreliable.</li>
		<li>When observing a researcher may miss important details as it is mainly observing people in their own culture.</li>
		</ul>	
		<h3>d)	Archaeology and palaeontology</h3>
		<p>
		Archaeology is the study of material remains from past human life and culture through scientific analysis.<br>
		</p>
		<h3><i>Examples of material remains include;</i></h3>
		<li>Store tools</li>
		<li>Pottery</li>
		<li>Wooden implements</li>
		<li>Metal objects</li>
		<li>Baskets</li>
		<li>Garments.</li>
		<h3><i>It also includes</i> </h3>
		<li>Shelters</li>
		<li>Rock paintings</li>
		<li>Art work.</li>
		<p>
		After studying the artefacts, the archaeologies reconstruct the activities of the people who lived in pre-historic time form various evidence such as the trace of weapons, coins, bones and traditional crafts.<br>
		Archaeologists often work with natural scientists such as palaeontologists.<br>
		Palaeontologist deals with fossils.<br> 
		Fossils are remains of pre-historical plant and animals.<br>

		</p>
		<h3><i>Advantages of Archaeology and palaeontology</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Archaeology gives detailed information on material culture that other sources may not have.</li>
		<li>It gives a sense of time as the artefacts can be dated.</li>
		<li>It compliments other sources of information and thus gives authentic information.</li>
		<li>It provides varied information depending on the material found at a site.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><i>Limitations  of Archaeology and palaeontology</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>It is expensive source of information because of the hiring labourers to excavate a site and the need for expensive archaeological equipments.</li>
		<li>It is time consuming during excavation process as well as taking materials to laboratories for analysis.</li>
		<li>Some artefacts and fossils are fragile and can disintegrate during excavation. This results in the distortion of analysis.</li>
		<li>It is only laminated to the study of ancient records and not recent history.</li>
		<li>Information may be inaccurate resulting from wrong conclusion or reconstructions.</li>
		<li>It is not easy to accurately determine date when events took place. It is only estimate through method of dating fossils.</li>
		<li>There are few archaeological experts and facilities for interpreting archaeological evidence in Kenya.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><i>Locating a historical site.</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Archaeologists look for areas where faulting or erosion has occurred exposing surfaces that may give clues to finding fossils and artefacts.</li>
		<li>Vision may help find early areas of settlements such as a few stores in a regular pattern.</li>
		<li>Archaeologist may use long experience and skills to identify or potential site.</li>
		<li>Historical research and insights to areas of past civilization is useful in identifying a site.</li>
		<li>Cultivation and building / construction by people may accidently expose ancient objects that curiously in researchers.</li>
		</ul>
     </div>
	 <h3><i>e)	Genetics</i> </h3>
	 <p>
	 Genetics is the scientific study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics.<br>
		It therefore studies how characteristics are passed from parents to their offspring’s through their genes (this is known as hereditary).<br>

	 </p>
	 <h3><i>Advantages of Genetics</i> </h3>
	 <ul>
	 <li>Characteristics can be passed on to the next generation including a detail of colour, shape, blood group or gender.</li>
	 <li>It shows relationship between people who have a common ancestor.</li>
	 <li>It can distinguish one person from another.</li>
	 <li>Genetics can trace the movement of people or plants from their original habitat to other regions.</li>
	 <li>Genetics can help locate where and when animals were domesticated and their routes of migration with the help of zoologist.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <div id="topic19">
     <h2>Methods of dating fossils </h2>
	 <p>
	 The following methods are used by scientists to arrive at the age of fossils remains.<br>
	 </p>
	 <h3><i>1)	Geological Problems</i> </h3>
	 <p>
	 scientists have names for periods of past time characterized by successive types of plants and animals, and by climatic changes.<br> 
	 </p>
	 <h3><i>2)	Chemical Dating</i> </h3>
	 <p>
	 Chemical Dating such as <b>radio-carbon dating and potassium-argon</b> method.<br>
	 Dating measures the use of decay potassium to give out the gas argon.<br>
		Radio-carbon dating measures the rate of decay carbon fossils and organic substance.<br>
		Hence the amount of argon-40 compared to the account of potassium gives direct measures of age.<br>
		<b>Potassium-argon method</b>- is used to date volcanic ash. Potassium is emitted during volcanic eruptions. <br>
		This method is also used to date minerals containing potassium.<br>
		As soon as the potassium is deposited, the radioactive potassium-40 immediately begins to decay into the gas argon.<br>
		The argon is retained in the mineral or rock unless there is earth movement, given that the rate of decay of potassium is unknown, the amount of argon-40 compared with the amount of potassium, v=gives a direct measure of age.<br>

	 </p>
	 <h3><i>3)	Stratigraphy</i> </h3>
	 <p>The study and interpretation layers of rocks successfully deposited at a place (sedimentation).<br></p>
	 <h3><i>4)	Fission-Track Dating</i> </h3>
	 <p>The age of minerals and glass as estimated by observing the tracks made in them by the fission fragment of the uranium made that they contain.<br></p>
	 <h3><i>5)	Lexico- Statistics Dating</i> </h3>
	 <p>The study of vocabulary of languages with the interest to determine their age and their historical lines with other languages.<br></p>
	 <h3><i>6)	Statistical Dating</i> </h3>
	 <p>The use of calculation using a system of arranging the length of generation can be determined for a particular society.<br></p>
	 <div id="topic110">

		<h5><i>a)Creation theory</h5></i>

		The theory of Creation is found in the Christian and Muslim Holy books that is in Bible and Quran respectively.<br>
		These books stated that God created the universe and all other living creatures including man in six days.<br> 
		The creation of first man has been explained to both Bible and Quran named ‘Adam’ and his wife in the Bible she called ‘Eve’ and in the Quran she called Hawa<br>
		God blessed them and told them to reproduce and fill the Earth, He gave them the authority over the other creatures on earth.<br>
		Adam and Eve/Hawa were both sent to live in the Garden of Eden but when they sinned God threw them away out of the heaven and sent them to live on earth.<br>
		Therefore, all humans are descendants of Adam and Eve/Hawa.<br>
		<h5><i>b)Evolution theory</h5></i>
		Evolution theory seek to explain the origin of man using the scientific approach.<br>
		They state that man originated from simple life then slowly transformed over millions of years.<br>
		Charles Darwin a British scientist in his book explain that animals and plants evolved from simple living cells to the complex animals of today as a results of environment adaptions.<br>
		According to Darwin’s human beings and primates have common ancestors and he come to the conclusion
		after his studies on different species of plants and animals and found that both plants and animal were capable of transformation and survival of plants and animals depends on their ability to apply changes to their environment.<br>

     <h2>Introduction to the people of kenya</h2> 
	 <p>
	 East Africa is referred to as the cradle of human kind; it was due to the following reasons.<br>  
		The area has a rich variety of environmental factors conducive to human settlement with plenty of opportunists for hunters and gathers and even agriculturalists.<br>
		Tools found in koobi for a near lake turkana are attributed to homo habilies.<br> 
		All these pieces of evidence point to the fact that Kenya has inhabited by mankind million of years ago.<br>
		Animals such as cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated in Kenya during the late Stone Age in kenya.<br>
		Oral traditions points to the possibility that the earliest group of people to occupy present day Kenya were of the khoisan-stock.<br>
	 The inhabitants appeared to have similar features with the khoihoi and the san of South Africa and the sandawe and thadza of Tanzania.<br>
	 They are described as having spoken a language which had ``clicking’’ sounds like of the khoihoi of south Africa.<br>
		In western Kenya the earliest inhabitants were the okuru and ongaye who h been totally assimilated by the Bantu and luo groups.<br>
		Another group of early inhabitants in Kenya were of the Cushitic stock.<br> 
		Although their origin is not clear they seem to have been living in the Ethiopian highlands before spreading and settling in Kenya.<br>
		<h3><i>Kenya today is divided into three main linguistic groups namely;</h3></i>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Bantus.</b></li>
		<li><b>Nilotes.</b></li>
		<li><b>Cushites.</b></li>
		</ul>
		The largest group comprises the Bantu speakers who are believed to have migrated from the area around cameroon and the congo water shed.<br>
		The nilotes who claim southern Sudan as their cradle land are 2nd largest group of people in Kenya. The plain nilotes and the highland nilotes point to the north of Lake Turkana as their original homeland.<br>
		The 3rd linguistic group comprises the cushite who entered Kenya from the red sea.<br>

		<div id="topic32">
     <h2>Cushitic speakers</h2> 
	 <p>
	 There were two cushites speakers group who migrated into Kenya this were;
	 </p>
	 <li><b>Southern cushites.</b></li>
	 <li><b>Eastern cushites</b></li>
	 <h3><i>a)	Southern cushites</i></h3>
	 <p>
	 They arrived in Kenya earlier than the eastern cushites.<br>
		They migrated into Kenya form the Ethiopian highlands and settled in Kenya and northern tanzaina.<br>
		This included the boni, Iraqi and burungi of Tanzania and dahallo and sanye of the lower tana who are the only remain southern cushites group in Kenya.<br>

	 </p>
	  <h3><i>b)	Eastern cushites.</i></h3>

	  <li><b>Rendile</li></b>
	  <li><b>Burji</li></b>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  These people migrated into Kenya much later than southern cushites.<br>
	  They settled 1st in horn of Africa after migrating from Arabia around 1000bc then southwards into modern Somali and reached the northern borders of Kenya.<br>
	  </p>
	 <h3><i>Reasons for their migration</h3></i>
	 <ul>
	 <li>Escaping from clan/ family feuds/conflicts.</li>
	  <li>Population pressure in the area of origin.</li>
	   <li>Search of better grazing lands.</li>
	    <li>Fleeing outbreak of disease affecting both people and animals.</li>
		 <li>Escaping famine and drought.</li>
		  <li>Fled constant attacks from neighbours such as Somali.</li>
		   <li>Migrated to satisfy their spirit of adventure.</li>
	 </ul>
		<h3><i>Results of cushites migration into Kenya.</h3></i>
		<ul>
		<li>During the migrations some people fought killing many people in the process like Somali amd oromo.</li>
		<li>There was displacement of other communities in Kenya.</li>
		<li>Some communities interacted and formed alliances e.g rendile and Samburu formed an alliance against turkana.</li>
		<li>Migration led to increase in population.</li>
		<li>The cushites introduced some cultural practises in kenya like, age set and taboo of eating fish.</li>
		<li>Led to intermarriages between them and other group’s e.g pokomo and borana.</li>
		<li>The cushites intensified trading activities in Kenya.</li>
		<li>Their migration led to redistribution of population in Kenya.</li>

		They occupy about 2/3 of Africa south of the sahara.<br>
		Historian agrees that the original homeland of the Bantu was somewhere between eastern Nigeria and the Cameroon generally referred to as the Congo basin.<br>
		From here they moved southwards towards the present day of democratic republic of Congo (DRC) the east wards to eastern Africa.<br>

	 </p>
		<h3><i>Abaluyia.</h3></i>
		<p>
		The abalulya oral traditions indicate that they migrated from an area called ``misri’’.<br>
		Historical evidence shows that the abaluyia had intermarriage with several ethnic groups in the course of their migration.<br>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Before the 1st century most of the east African community interacted with one another through intermarriage and trade.<br>
		However between the 1st and the 19th century they interacted with people from other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa.<br>
		This contact was first at the coast and later to the interior.<br>
		The contacts were between the African, Arabs, Greeks, Chinese, Romans, Portuguese, Persians, British and Dutch.<br>
		The dominant among these were the Arabs (introduced Islam) and the Portuguese (introduced Christianity)<br>
		They settled at the cost and conquered the local people at deferent periods hence creating a profound influence on the coast and the interior of east Africa.<br>
		</p>
		<h3><i>The East African Coast</i></h3>
		<p>
		Historical information about east African coast before the 7th century is scanty due to inadequate written evidence.<br>
		The documentary, archaeological, authropogical, linguistical and oral traditions have appointed to the presence of early visistors at the coast.<br>
		Other sources include periplus of the Erythrean Sea which involved sailing around the Indian Ocean. It was written by a Greek commercial agent in 120AD in Egypt.<br>

		
		</p>
		<div id="topic52">
		<h2>The Documents used as sources of evidences</h2>
		<h3><i> a) The cloudius Ptolemy</i></h3>
		<p>
		He wrote a book “geography’’ which talked about trade in the east African coast.<br>
		The book also had documents by Arab merchant’s e.g ibu batuta, ali masudi, al edvis.<br>

		
		</p>
		
		<h3><i> b) The Christian topography</i></h3>
		<p>
		Written in the 1st half of the 6th century and talked about the Persian dominant of the Indian Ocean trade.
		</p>
		<h3><i> c) Greco- roman documentary</i></h3>

	  <h2>Early visitors to the east African coast up the 15th century</h2>
	  <h3><i>Factors that enabled the early visitors to come and settle at the east African coast</i></h3>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Contact between east Africa and the  early visitors was possible because of the accessibility of the coast by the sea from sofala(Mozambique) to Mogadishu(Somali)</li>
		<li>The area had big harbour where ships could anchor</li>
		<li>Availability of islands e.g. Mombasa and Zanzibar which divided the mainland by a narrow channel.</li>
		<li>There were moon soon winds which blew between November to April hence enhancing the most of ships.</li>
		<li>The earliest visitors were Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Arabs, Syrians, Egyptians, Phoenicians and Portuguese.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i> a) Greek</i></h3>
		<p>
		They came to the east African coast after 326BC, after the death of Alexander the great.<br>
		The Greek empire had controlled the Middle East, North Africa and India.<br>
		Egypt in North Africa was under the dynasty of Ptolemy and Syria was under the dynasty of Seleucids who were both Greek generals.<br>
		Both Egyptians and Syrians got ivory from India via the Syrian route.<br>
		The Greek generals blocked the route to India forcing the Greek ptolemies of Egypt to get an alternative route and alternative source of ivory.<br>
		Hence they travelled via the red sea and down along the east Africa.<br>
		Therefore Egyptian ptolemies and east African coast developed and stretched as far as dar-es-salaam.<br>

		</p>
		
		<h3><i>b) Romans</i></h3>
		<p>
		The Romans like the Greek had greater demand for goods such as ivory, species, gold, precious stones, rhino horns and slaves.<br>
		The Romans therefore wanted to break the Arab monopoly over trade.<br>
		In 45AD the roman sailor called hippaplus sailed via the red sea to the Indian Ocean during the reign of Augustus ceaser.<br>
		He had the knowledge of the moonson winds, hence the Romans sailed directly to India via the Indian ocean and exchange their goods with glass, wine and wheat hence bringing them into Africa by the Indian ocean.<br>
		The Roman Empire collapsed in 15AD<br>

		</p>
		
			<h3><i>Persians</i></h3>
			<p>
			Persia was ruled by shirazi dynasty form 224-636 AD.<br>
			They wanted to rebuild their empire after its destruction by the Macedonian Greek.<br>
			By the 6th century the Persians were trading with India and china.<br>
			They controlled the red sea, part of Egypt and Arabia; latter the Persians came to east Africa coast and established their ruling dynasty.<br>
			They intermarried with local people and introduced Islamic civilization which included trade, architecture, religion and culture.<br>
			They traded with local people in items like bowls, glass, pots and swords.<br>
			They build towns e.g Zanzibar and lamu.<br>
			They called the coast of Zanzibar zenj (black), bar(coast) i.e. zenj bar –black coast.<br>
			They called the land between Mogadishu and cape Delgado the land of zenj( land of black people).<br>

			
			</p>
			
			<h3><i>Chinese</i></h3>
			<p>
			They visited the east African coast in large fleets of sheep around 1430 AD.<br>
			Chinese authors during the dynast of sung (960-1279AD) and ming (1368-1644AD) were familiar with the east African coast.<br>
			The Chinese coins dating 700AD have been found at the east African coast.<br>
			Through y=trade the Chinese silk cloths, porcelain bowls and plates in return they acquired ivory, gold, leopard skins, rhino horns and tortoise shells.<br>

			</p>
			<h3><i>Arabs</i></h3>
			<p>
			The Arabs came to the east African coast for trade by 650AD.<br>
			The earliest Arab settlement was at pemba and later kilwa, lamu, maunda, Mombasa and later to 37 other towns to the east African coast.<br>
			The east African coast was attractive to the Arabs due to:<br>
			<b>Its offshore islands which were well watered had cool climate compared to hot Arabia.<br>
			Fertile soils for crop growing for the Arab population.</b><br>

			</p>
			<h3><i>Factors that facilitated coming of the Arabs</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Presence of moonson winds. I.e. the north east and the south west winds which blew the Arab ship from Arabia via the Indian Ocean.</li>
		<li>The ports of southern Arabia were good sailing places on the journey to east African coast.</li>
		<li>East African also deep harbours for ships to anchor.</li>
		<li>Arabs were skilled in marine technology i.e. boat making, map reading and use of compass.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><i>Reasons for the coming of the early visitors on the east African coast.</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>They wanted to trade and control the commercial activity along the coast.</li>
		<li>Some Arabs came as refuge fleeing religious and political persecutions in Arabia.</li>
		<li>Some came to explore the east African coast.</li>
		<li>Some came to spread their religion.</li>
		<li>Some came to establish settlement along the east African coast.</li>
		<li>Accessibility of east African coast to the outside world made some of them to come because of the cool climate and fertile soils found at the coast.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div id="topic54">
	  <h2>The Trade</h2>
		
		<h3><i>Trade between the east African coast and the outside world.</i></h3>
		<p>
		Historically the east coast of Africa has had contact with the Middle Eastern and far eastern countries for long.<br>
		It was established through Indian Ocean trade with the Egyptians, Greeks, Phoenician, Chinese, Persians, Indians and Arabs.<br>

		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>Organisation of trade</i></h3>
		<p>
		The coastal people organised themselves into caravans which moved along established trade routes.<br>
		They took interior guns, glass, beads, swords and porcelain bowls. Slaves were obtained either by raiding or through exchange with other goods.<br>
		The major markets for this trade were at the coast like Mombasa, Zanzibar and sofala.<br>

		</p>
		
		<h3><i>Impact of the Indian Ocean trade on the people of east Africa</i></h3>
		<ul>

		<li>Indigenous trades such as weaving, ironworking declined due to importation of foreign goods.</li>
		<li>Slave raids led to wars among African communities</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>The coming of the Portuguese.</i></h3>
		<p>
		It was the 1st European country to explore east African coast at 15th century supported by Prince Henry the navigator.<br>
		The 1st appearance of the Portuguese to the east African coast was in 1498 by vasco d agama.<br>
		</p>
		<h3><i>Reasons for the coming of the Portuguese to east Africa coast </i></h3>
		<p>
		They were interested in establishing a trading empire in the east.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>They wanted to convert the people of east Africa to Christianity.</li>
		<li>They had skilled navigators who were ready to carry out exploration voyages at the sea.</li>
		<li>They had for a long time been challenged by the Arabs and Turks over the eastern trade. To stop them, they had to control the east African coast.</li>
		<li>The east African coast was a mid-way between India and Europe. It could provide a base for the supply of fresh food and water.</li>
		<li>They were looking for a sea route to India.</li>
		<li>They wanted to revenge their earlier defeat by the Muslims who had conquered the Iberian Peninsula.</li>
		<li>The east African coastline had good natural harbours.</li>
		<li>The spirit of adventure was developed in Europe after the renaissance and the emergency of various geographical societies.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		<h3><i>Portuguese conquest and rule of the east coast of Africa</h3></i>
		In 1498 vasco da gama was the 1st sailor to reach east African coast with the aim to explore the coast.<br>
		He landed of the coast of Mozambique on March 1, 1498. The sultan of Mozambique was hostile to vasco d agama. He later sailed to Mombasa where he and his companions met a lot of hostility.<br>
		He left for malindi where he was warmly welcomed by seyyid ali, the sultan of malindi.<br>
		He was accorded all the assistance he needed including a gujerati pilot known as ahmed bin majid, to guide the crew to India.<br>
		The decisions to conquer the east coast of Africa was taken by the Portuguese after vasco d agama’s return to Portugal in 1499.he informed the king of Portugal about the lucrative trade between the coastal people and those from the middle and Far East.<br>
		In 1500 pedro alveres ras cabral led an expedition with the intention of capturing sofala but failed.<br>
		Vasco d agama led the next expedition against kilwa, which he conquered in 1502.
		In 1503 ruy lourenco ravasco defeated Zanzibar and forced its sultan to pay tributes to the king of Portugal.<br>
		In 1505 a large expedition of 20 ships and 1500 men under Francisco de almeida was sent to east African coast. It conquered sofala, kilwa and Mombasa.<br>

		</p>
		
		<h3><i>Reasons for Portuguese success</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>They had superior weapons and well trained soldiers compared to the coastal traders.</li>
		<li>They had better naval power like ships and dhows.</li>
		<li>There was disunity among the coastal city states.</li>
		<li>The Turkish and Persian navies in the Indian Ocean were too weak to offer any help to the coastal towns against the Portuguese.</li>
		<li>The Portuguese made alliances with some local rulers who sent soldiers to fight alongside the Portuguese.</li>
		<li>They were able to receive military assistance from their headquarters at goa in India.</li>
		<li>There was lack of resistance from some towns like sofala.</li>
	
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>Portuguese rule</i></h3>
		<p>
		They established their rule which lasted for 200 years and in 1507 they made Mozambique their headquarters.<br>
		It was under a captain who took orders from the Portuguese viceroy stationed at goa in southern India, later they divided the area into two and another captain was in Mombasa.<br>
		The duties of the captains were to collect tributes from the local rulers, impose custom duties on import and exports and to suppress resistance or opposition to their rule.<br> 
		They also supervised the ruling families in the city.<br>

		</p>
		
		<h3><i>Factors that led to the decline of Portuguese rule</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Inadequate personnel as compared to the vast east African coast.</li>
		<li>Portuguese officials were greedy and corrupt who amassed personal wealth at the expense of administration.</li>
		<li>Lack of systematic form of government.</li>
		<li>Portuguese faced hostility and rebellions from the coastal people.</li>
		<li>Decline in trade mad e them lose revenue for administration.</li>
		<li>Distance between Portugal and east Africa coast slowed reinforcement.</li>
		<li>Portuguese were attacked by tropical diseases.</li>
		<li>They were challenge by the Britain, Dutch, France and the Turks.</li>
		<li>At home, Portugal suffered annexation by Spain (1590 and 1640).</li>
		<li>In 1588, the coast was invaded by the zimba warriors from Mozambique which undermined their position in east African coast.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>Impact of the Portuguese rule.</i></h3>
		<h3><i>a) Negative Impact</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Coastal towns and their people were exposed to heavy taxation.</li>
		<li>They discouraged other trading powers from visiting the city due to their presence.</li>
		<li>Some coastal towns declined due to people moving away to escape taxation and other interior traders avoided them.</li>
		<li>The Portuguese demand for slaves on their plantations abroad increased raids, which were perfected with the use of new more powerful ammunition.</li>
		<li>There was segregation of the local people.</li>
		<li>The corrupt, ruthless Portuguese officials misruled the cities leading to misery and suffering.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>b) positive Impact</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>There was introduction of new crops like maize, groundnuts, cassava, pineapples, pawpaw and guavas.</li>
		<li>They introduced new word which enriched Kiswahili like meza(table) and mvinyo (wine).</li>
		<li>They built historical monuments like fort Jesus and vasco da gama pillar.</li>
		<li>Closer links were established between the east African coast and goa in India.</li>
		<li>They also introduced Christianity.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The establishment and impact of Oman rule in east Africa coast.<br>
		In 1698, the Portuguese’s were driven out of the coastal region and taken over by the Oman Arabs. The imam became the ruler of the east African coast.<br>
		At the initial stages of their rule, the imams could not come from the Oman to enforce their rule on the coastal due to civil wars in their homeland.<br>
		So they were ruled by local Arab family the mazurui rule Mombasa and nabahan family ruled lamu.<br>
		The mazurui family were troublesome to the imams for they wanted to be independent as they forced towns like Malindi, pate and Pemba to pay allegiance to them.<br>

		</p>
		<h3><i>Seyyid said’s reign 1804-1856</i></h3>
		<p>
		He wanted to the master of the whole Indian Ocean trade. 
		To consolidate his power and protect his east Africa interests, he transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1846.
		</p>
		<h3><i>Reasons for choosing Zanzibar were</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Zanzibar was loyal to him.</li>
		<li>Zanzibar was a green and pleasant island with a good climate compared to Muscat which was hot and dry.</li>
		<li>Had good harbours in which ships could anchor.</li>
		<li>Had good and clean water.</li>
		<li>Its position was convenient for trade with the mainland and also with Mombasa to the north.</li>
		<li>Its climate and fertile soils were good for cultivating cloves.</li>
		<p>
		Seyyid controlled the whole of the coast and developed trade links with the interior and some communities in Kenya like akamba and mijikenda got involved in it.<br>
		The main exports were slaves, ivory and cloves, caravans were sent out into the interior to collect slaves and ivory.<br>

		</p>

		<li>Growth of towns like Zanzibar.</li>
		<li>Local, long distance and international trade grew.</li>
		<li>Linked east Africa coast to the rest of the world.</li>
		<li>Spread of Islamic religion.</li>
		<li>Growth of plantation agriculture.</li>
		<li>Missionaries came to east Africa coast in an attempt to stop slave trade.</li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>Development of plantation agriculture</i></h3>
		<p>
		It was the major cause of increased slave trade in the 19th century who became labourers in agricultural plantations.<br>
		By 1840 clove plantations in Zanzibar and Pemba had attracted slave labour and slaves were heavily overworked.<br>
		In 1840’s the Arabs and Swahili started growing grain on the mainland and this continued up to the beginning of colonial period.<br>
		In Malinda several planters had acquired land of over 400 hectares where hundreds of slaves were used to plant millet and sesame.<br> 
		The success of plantations depended on the long working of slaves.<br>
		In Mombasa it was cultivation of coconut because their farms were small and required less labourers and more yield compared to grains per hectare.<br>
		On the mainland, the Swahili also became major planters. The mijikenda sub-tribe did not participate in plantation agriculture; they traded with the Arabs and sold ivory, cattle and grain.<br>
		Often slaves attempted to escape from plantations. There were efforts to improve their conditions; some of them who ran away were employed by rich Arabs and Swahili in their armies to fight against the sultan’s government.<br>

		<h3><i>Factors that facilitated plantations agriculture by seyyid said in east Africa coast</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Existence of slave labour.</li>
		<li>Fertile soils that favoured farming.</li>
		<li>Presence of large tracts of land for plantation farming in the mainland and the coast.</li>
		<li>the coast had suitable climate and abundant rainfall.</li>
		<li>There was high demand for grains at the coast and overseas.</li>
		<li>Large number of Oman settlers who settled in Malinda, lamu, Mombasa acquired land for crop growing.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<h3><i>Effects of plantation agriculture on the east Africa coast</i></h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Need for slave labour increased slave trade.</li>
		<li>Growth of cash crops for export led to international trade.</li>
		<li>Introduction of new crops at the coast.</li>
		<li>Agro-based industries emerged.</li>

		<h3><i>Development, organization and consequences of trade</i></h3>
		<p>
		By the 19th century, trade connections among the Kenya communities and also between Kenya and other countries had already been established.
		</p>
		<h3><i>Development of long distance trade</i></h3>
		<p>
		It connected the interior of east Africa with the coastal in Kenya with commodities like ivory and slave with exchange with clothes, utensils, ironware and beads.<br>
		The akamba and the mijikenda acted middlemen between the interior communities and the coast; they travelled to Mount Kenya region looking for slaves and ivory and all the way to baringo and Lake Victoria.<br>
		They tried to keep good relation with the communities they passed through and discouraged other communities from participating in long distance trade by spreading malicious tales.<br>
		The Arabs and Swahili in 1860s took control of the interior and used caravans into the interior as far as Uganda.<br>

		</p>
		<h3><i>Organization of the trade</i></h3>
		<p>
		The people involved were the akamba, yao, nyamwezi and mijikenda.trade routes went all the way to kilomanjaro, m.t. Kenya and lake Victoria region but they did avoid maasai region due to hostility.<br>
		They gathered in the coast and moved in caravans to the interior. The goods were carried to and from the coast by porters who were either free men or slaves.<br>
		Items of trade included guns, cotton, cloth, beads, glass, swords, porcelain vessels, bracelets and bangles.<br>
		From the interior the traders obtained ivory, rhino horns, slaves, hides and skins.<br>

		<li>Decline of indigenous industries due to many foreign goods which were cheap.</li>
		<li>Promoted slavery and slave trade.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><i>International trade</i></h3>
		<p>
		These was achieved through the opening up of the interior by seyyid said  who took control of the east Africa mainland and encouraged foreign traders to trade with Zanzibar.<br>
		He encouraged Indian merchants (banyans) to come add settle in Zanzibar since they were traders and money lenders.<br>
		He did sign treaties with the United States of America (1844), Britain (1839) and France (1844).<br>
		He also opened up to trading links with Germany.<br>
