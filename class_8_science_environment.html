	<h1>Environment</h1>
	<h3 id="A1">Soil pollution</h3>
	<p>Soil is polluted when harmful substances are introduced to it making it unfit for plant and animal life. It affects and endangers the living components of the soil. Things that contaminate soil are known as pollutants. They include:
	
	<ul>
		<li>Polythene papers</li>
		<li>Pesticides</li>
		<li>Sewage water</li>
		<li>Fertilisers</li>
		<li>Herbicides</li>
		<li>Spilled oil</li>
		<li>Industrial wastes</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h4>Other causes of soil pollution</h4>
	<p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Disposal of domestic waste on the soil</li>
			<li>Raw waste from burst sewage pipes</li>
			<li>Excessive use of farm chemicles</li>
			<li>Mining related activities and sand harvesting.</li>
			<li>Industrial waste that are allowed to flow into water sources.</li>
			
		</ul>

	</p>

	
		<h4 id="A2">Effects of soil pollution</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Soil polution kills the plant and animals that aerate the soil..</li>
			<li>Pollutants, such as polythene, block the penetration of roots into the soil.</li>
			<li>Pollution of soil affects the absorption of water and mineral salts by roots.</li>
			<li>Non-biodegradable wastes reduce the quality of the soil and affect the growth of plants.</li>
			
		</ul>
	</p>

		<h4>Effects of soil pollution on animals</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pollution in soil kills small animals, like microorganism, which aerate the soil affecting productivity.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4>Soil Conservation</h4>
	<p>
		Soil conservation means proper use, care and protection of soil to maintain its fertility. Plants require fertile soils for higher yields. Soil conservation methods include:
		<ul>
			<li>Avoiding excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides.</li>
			<li>Avoiding dumping of industrial wastes on the soil</li>
			<li>Avoiding burning vegetation cover</li>
			<li>Mulching the soil to conserve the soil moisture</li>
			<li>Planting of cover crops such as grass and sweet potatoes.</li>
			<li>Building of terraces on steep slopes.</li>
			<li>Practicing contour farming on gentle slopes.</li>
			<li>Planting of trees to act as wind breakers.</li>
			<li>Building gabions to control gulley erosion.</li>
			<li>Controlled grazing.</li>
			<li>Proper stocking of livestock. Not keeping so many animals that land cannot support.</li>
			<li>Proper disposal of industrial and domestic wastes by treating, recycling or reusing.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

			<h4>Air Pollution</h4>
	<p>
		Air can be made impure by harmful substances called pollutants. The different ways that air can be polluted are:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Smoking cigarettes.</li>
			<li>Burning of tyres and plastic materials.</li>
			<li>Fumes or gases from vehicle exhausts.</li>
			<li>Spraying farm chemicals</li>
			<li>Aerosal sprays and perfumes</li>
			<li>Industrial waste gases</li>
		</ul>
		The gases that can pollute air include:
		<ul>
			<li>Carbon monoxide</li>
			<li>Sulphur dioxide</li>
			<li>excess carbon dioxide</li>
			<li>Smoke</li>
			<li>Dust</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		<h4 id="A3">Effects of air pollution on plants</h4>
	<p>
		Dust particles in the air block stomata on leaves hence interfering with photosynthesis. Air pollution, by sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide, can lead to formation of acid rain that affects plant growth. Air pollution makes plants and their produce harmful to human beings.
	</p>
		<h4>Effects of air pollution on animals</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Causes respiratory diseases in animals</li>
			<li>Carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide cause acid rain that is harmful to animals that live in water.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<h3>Effects of air pollution on non-living things</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Acid rain caused by air pollution corrodes roofs made of corrugated iron sheets.</li>
		<li>Excess dust particles in the air lead to damage of the environment in general.</li>
		<li>Acid rain makes the soil more acidic. They become less fertile and unsuitable for plant growth.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Ways of controlling air pollution</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>Avoiding smoking of cigarretes</li>
			<li>Not burning tyres and plastic materials</li>
			<li>Driving vehicles with well-maintained engines.</li>
			<li>Reducing excessive use of farm chemicals.</li>
			<li>Avoiding use of harmful aerosol sprays.</li>
			<li>Treating gaseous waste from industrial to make them safe</li>
	</ul>
