	<h1>Energy</h1>
	<h3 id="A1">Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	Energy is the ability to do work. Work is only considered done when force is applied over some distance


	<h3 id="A2">Types of energy</h3>
	<p>
	There are different types of energy.
	</p>
	<h4>Chemical Energy</h4>
	<p>
		<ul> 
			<li>This is also known as stored energy.</li>
			<li>Chemical energy is found in food, dry cells, batteries, fuels such as firewood, petrol, kerosine and diesel.</li>
			<li>The chemical energy in fuels is released when they burn.</li>
			<li>The body is able to store the food we eat as chemical energy.</li>
			
				
			
			
		</ul>

	</p>

	
		<h4 id="A3">Heat Energy</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Heat energy is mainly obtained from the sun.</li>
			<li>Heat energy can also be obtained from electrical or any burning fuel. Rubbing two surfaces also produces heat.</li>
			<li>Heat energy can be used for cooking, ironing clothes, warming ourselves and drying.</li>

			
		</ul>
	</p>

		<h4 id="A4">Light Energy</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Light Energy mainly comes from the sun.</li>
			<li>Other sources of light energy include candles, electric bulbs, gas lamps and gas lihters.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4 id="A5">Magnetic Energy</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the force of attraction from a magnet.</li>
			<li>Magnetic energy can be used to lift heavy containers at the port</li>
		</ul>
			
		
	</p>

<h4 id="A6">Electricity</h4>
	<p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>This is the energy produced from chemical reactions taking place in things like batteries.</li>
					<li>There are two types of electricity namely static and current electricity.</li>
					<li>Static electricity comes from charged particles as a result of rubbing</li>
					<li>Current electricity comes from car batteries, dry cells, bicycle dynamoes, hydroelectric generators, geothermal generators, wind driven turbines, solar panels, petrol and diseal driven generators.</li>
					<li>Electric energy can be used in different ways such as lighting a house, running different electrical appliances, cooking and for running big machines in factories.</li>
					
				</ul>
	</p>


		<h4 id="A7">Sound Energy</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects.</li>
			<li>The speaker in a radio vibrates to produce sound.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
			
	<p>
		<h4>Transformation of energy</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The change of energy from one form to another is called transformation.</li>
			<li>Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only be transformed from one form to another.</li>
			<li>The existance of energy is only noticed during its transformation from one form to another</li>
			
		</ul>
	</p>
		


<p>
	<h4>Transformation of energy in an electric circuit</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>An electric circuit is a closed path which allows an electric current to flow</li>
			<li>During the flow of an electric circuit the following transformations of energy occur.
			<bdi>Chemical energy</bdi>-<bdi>electrical energy</bdi> - <bdi>heat + light energy</bdi>

			</li>

		
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
		<h4>Transformation of energy in food</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The food we eat has stored energy (chemical energy)</li>
			<li>The food is broken down in the body to produce heat energy that keeps the body warm.</li>
			<li>Heat energy also helps in motion and doing work.</li>
			<li>Energy in motion is known as kinetic energy</li>
			<p> <bdi>Chemical energy</bdi> - <bdi>Heat energy</bdi> - <bdi>Kinetic energy</bdi></p>
			
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Transformation of energy in burning fuels</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Fuels have chemical energy</li>
			<li>The chemical energy is transformed to heat during burning.</li>
			<li>The heat energy can then be used for warming or cooking</li>
			
			
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		<h4>Transformation of energy in a radio</h4>
		A radio that uses dry cells transform energy as follows
		<bdi>Chemical enrgy</bdi> - <bdi>Electrical Energy</bdi> - <bdi>Magnetic</bdi> - <bdi>kinetic</bdi> - <bdi>sound</bdi>
		<ul>
			<li>Fuels have chemical energ</li>
			<li>The chemical energy is transformed to heat during burning.</li>
			<li>The heat energy can then be used for warming or cooking</li>
			
			
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h4>Transformation of energy in an electromagnet</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The energy transformations in an electromagnet are:
			<bdi>Chemical energy</bdi>-<bdi>Electrical energy</bdi>-<bdi>Magnetic energy</bdi>
			</li>
			<li>The magnetic energy can be made strong by
			<ul>
				<li>Increasing the voltage or the number of dry cells</li>
				<li>Increasing the number of coils on the iron rod</li>
				<li>Using a soft iron rod</li>
			</ul>

			</li>
			
			
		</ul>
