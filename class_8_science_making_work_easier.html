	<h1>Making Work Easier</h1>
	<h3 id="A1">Simple machines</h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>A machine is a device on which force is applied to make work easier.</li>
		<li>The simple machines we are going to study are <bdi>Inclined planes</bdi> and <bdi>Single fixed pulleys.</bdi></li>
		<li>Chancroid</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h4 id="A2">Inclined planes</h4>
	<p>
		<ul> 
			<li>An inclined plane is a slope. It can be gentle or slopy..</li>
			<li>An inclined plane makes work easier by increasing the effort distance.</li>
			<li>Examples of inclined planes include:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Ladder</li>
				<li>A ramp</li>
				<li>Spiral stairs</li>
				<li>Ladder</li>
				<li>A road winding up a hill</li>
				<li>Staircase</li>
				<li>Escalators</li>
				<li>Screws</li>
			</ul>
				
			
			
		</ul>

	</p>

	
		<h4 id="A3">Using an inclined plane</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Place two ladders of similar height on the wall one forming a steep slope and the other forming a gentle slope.</li>
			<li>Climb the two ladders one at a time with a friend holding it securely.</li>
			<li>Which ladder is easier to climb?</li>
			<li>Which ladder is more difficult to climb?.</li>
			
		</ul>
	</p>

		<h4 id="A4">Observation</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is easier to climb the ladder with a gentle slope.</li>
			<li>It is more difficult to climb the ladder with a steep slope.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4 id="A5">Conclusion</h4>
	<p>
			
		It is easier to climb the ladder with a gentle slope because it reduces the steepness up the wall. Staircases, escalators and spiral stairs make it easier to climb to a floor of a building by reducing the slope and increasing the effort distance.
		</p>

<h4 id="A6">Road winding up a hill</h4>
	<p>
	Vlimbing up a long the winding route is much easier as the road is not so steep. However, one has to travel a much longer distance to reach the top.
	</p>
		<h4>Screw</h4>
	<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The distance between the threads on the screw determines how easy it is to use.</li>
					<li>When the threads are far apart, it becomes difficult to drive the screw.</li>
					
				</ul>
	</p>

		<h4 id="A7">Single fixed pulley</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>A single fixed pulley can be used to lift heavy loads from lorries or into them.</li>
			<li>It can be used in raising a flag.</li>
			<li>Single fixed pulleys can be used by break-down vehicles to pull vehicles involved in accidents or mechanical problems.</li>
			<li>Single fixed pulleys can also be used at construction sites to lift heavy loads and building materials.</li>
			</ul>
	</p>
		<h4>Using a single fixed pulley</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>When the effort is pulled, the load moves in the opposite direction.</li>
			<li>When the effort is pulled down 1 meter, the load moves up 1 metre.</li>
			<li>The effort distance is equal to the distance moved by the load.</li>
			<li>The pulley wheel changes the direction of the force applied.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		


</p>
	<h4>Measuring the effort used in a single fixed pulley</h4>
	<ul>
			<li>The effort or force applied on a single fixed pulley can be measured using a spring balance.</li>
			<li>The spring balance is fixed on the effort side.</li>
			<li>How the spring balance stretches shows how much effort is used to lift the load.</li>
			<li>The effort used is usually slightly more than the load.</li>
			
			
	</ul>
