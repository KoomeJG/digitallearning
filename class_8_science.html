	<h1>Animals</h1>
	<h3 id="A1">Adaptation in animals</h3>
	<p>For animals to live and survive in their environment, they need to have certain adaptations for feeding and movement.
	</p>
	<h3>Feeding habits of mammals</h3>
	<p>Mammals are divided into three groups according to the food they eat. These are:
	<ul>
		<li>Herbivores - Those that feed on Plants</li>
		<li>Carnivores - Those that feed on flesh</li>
		<li>Omnivores - Those that feed on both plants and flesh</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h4 id="A2">Feeding adaptations of herbivores</h4>
	<p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Some feed by Grazing while others browse</li>
			<li>Those that feed by grazing are called <bdi>Grazers</bdi></li>
			<li>Those that feed by browsing are called browsers</li>
			<li>Herbivores have long rough tongues for grasping and Collecting grass</li>
			<li>They have no teeth on the front part of the uper jaw. Instead, they have a horny pard thath helps in holding grass before cutting.
			<li>They have incisors teeth for cutting grass and premolars and molars for grinding and chewing grass.</li>
			<li>They have a gap on the lower jaw between canines and premolars called the diastema.</li>
			<li>The diastema is used for manipulation of the vegetation by the tongue while grazing. It also helps in grasping and rolling of the food before swallowing</li>
			<li>The teeth of the herbivores grow through out since they ussually wear out during feeding</li>
			<li>Examples of <bdi>herbivores</bdi> are <bdi>Zebras</bdi>,<bdi>cows</bdi>,<bdi>goats</bdi>and <bdi>sheep</bdi></li>
			
		</ul>

	</p>

	
		<h4 id="A3">Feeding adaptations of Carnivores</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Their teeth are well-developed for various uses.</li>
			<li>They have sharp, pointed canines for catching, holding and killing prey.</li>
			<li>The canines are also used for tearing flesh</li>
			<li>The molar and premolars are adapted for breaking bones.</li>
			<li>A combination of the last premolars on the upper jaw and the first molars on the lower jaw are well-developed. They are called carnassial teeth. These are used for breaking bones and cutting big chunks of meat.</li>
			<li>The teeth of carnivores are well spaced on the jaw to stop meat from getting stuck in between the teeth</li>
			<li>Examples of carnivores are <bdi>dogs</bdi>, <bdi>cats</bdi>, <bdi>hyenas</bdi>,<bdi>cheetahs</bdi> and <bdi>jackals</bdi></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		<h4 id="A4">Feeding adaptations of omnivores</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>They have chisel-shaped incisors for biting and cutting food.</li>
			<li>They have sharp, pointed canines for tearing flesh.</li>
			<li>They have flat premolars and molars with ridges known as cusps for grinding food.</li>
			<li>Examples of omnivores are <bdi>human beings</bdi>,<bdi>gorillar</bdi> and <bdi>baboons</bdi></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4 id="A5">Feeding adaptations of birds</h4>
	<p>
		Differnt birds have beaks that vary in size and shape depending on the type of food the bird feeds on.
			<h4>Grain Eaters</h4>
				The beaks of grain eaters are straight, strong,thick and conical for picking grains and seeds which the birds then swallow. Examples of grain eaters are <bdi>weaver birds</bdi>,<bdi>chicken</bdi>,<bdi>doves</bdi>,<bdi>guinea fowls</bdi> and <bdi>pigeons.</bdi>
		
	</p>
<h4 id="A6">Filter Feeders</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Filter feeders obtain food from water and mud.</li>
			<li>The beaks of filter feeders are serrated.</li>
			<li>The beaks are thick and flat.They are also strong and long.</li>
			<li>The edges of the beaks have rows of connected V-shaped teeth-like structures. These are what make the beak serrated to filter food from mud. Examples of filters feeders are ducks and flamingoes.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		<h4 id="A7">Flesh eaters</h4>
	<p>
		The beaks of flesh eating birds are strong, curved, hooked and sharp for cutting and tearing flesh. Examples of flesh eaters are eagles, hawks, kites and falcons
	</p>
		<h4>Nector feeders</h4>
	<p>
		The beak of a nector feeder is slender (thin) long and slightly curved to reach the nectar in flowers. Example of a nectar feeder is a sunbird.
	</p>
<h3 id="A8">Adaptations of animals for movements</h3>
<p>Animals are adapted for movement in different ways.</p>

<h4>Adaptation to flying</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>presence of wings with light feathers for flying</li>
			<li>Streamlined body to reduce air resistance during flight</li>
			<li>Hollow bones which make the bird light.</li>
			
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Adaptation to swimming</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>Animals like frogs, have webbed feet to enable them wade in water without sinking</li>
			<li>They also have streamlined bodies to reduce friction during swimming.</li>
			<li>Fins as in fish help to propel and balance fish as they swim.</li>
			
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Adaptation to hopping and leaping</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>Strong hinf legs. Frogs, grasshoppers and kangaroos have strong hind legs for hopping and leaping.</li>
			<li>They have short fore limbs to enable safe landing.</li>
			
	</ul>
</p>


<h4 id="A9">Signs of ill-health in livestock</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>Stunted growth</li>
			<li>Loss of weight</li>
			<li>Reduced Yields</li>
			<li>Rough coat</li>
			<li>Coughing</li>
			<li>Blood in stool</li>
			
		</ul>
</p>

<h4>Effects of livestock diseases</h4>
<p>
	<ul>
			<li>Lower yields</li>
			<li>Reduced quality of products</li>
			<li>Transimission of diseases to human beings</li>
			<li>May cause death</li>
			
	</ul>
