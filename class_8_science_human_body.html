	<h3 id="A1">Reproduction in human beings</h3>
	<p>Reproduction is the process of giving rise to new offspring. Reproduction involves fusion of male and female sex cells. These cells are called reproductive cells.
	<ul>		
		<li>A mature male produces sex cells called sperms.</li>
		<li>Sperms are produced in the testes</li>
		<li>A sperm has a head, a neck and a tail.</li>
		<li>The head of the sperm has a nucleus.</li>
		<li>The tail helps the sperm to swim in semen.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	<ul>		
		<li>A mature female produces sex cells called Ova(singular -ovum).</li>
		<li>The ova are produced by the ovaries</li>
		<li>The release of an ovum by the ovary is known as ovulation.</li>
		<li>Each ovary alternately produces an ovum once every twenty eight days.</li>
		<li>The ovum has a york that covers the nucleus.</li>
		<li>It has a life span of two days when not fertilised</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h4 id="A2">Fertilisation</h4>
	<p>
		<ul> 
			<li>This is the fusion of the nucleus of the male and the female sex cells.</li>
			<li>The resulting cell formed is acalled called a<bdi>Zygote</bdi></li>
			<li>The resulting cell formed is called a Zygote.</li>
			<li>Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct or fallopian tube</li>
			
		</ul>

	</p>

	
		<h4 id="A3">Implantation</h4>
	<p>
		After fertilisation, the zygote moves to the womb(uterus) where it attaches itself to the walls of the uterus using finger-like projections. The process by which the zygote attaches itself to the walls of the uterus is called implantation.
	</p>

		<h4 id="A4">Foetal development</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The zygote, after implantation, is called the <bdi> embroy</bdi></li>
			<li>The finger-like projections that attach the Zygote to the walls of the uterus then form the <bdi>umbilical cord </bdi> and <bdi>Placenta</bdi></li>
			<li>The <bdi>embryo</bdi> after eight weeks becomes a <bdi>foetus</bdi> and finally a baby.</li>
			<li>The order of development is: <bdi>Zygote</bdi>-<bdi>embryo</bdi>-<bdi>foetus</bdi>-<bdi>baby</bdi></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h4 id="A5">Functions of the umbilical cord</h4>
	<p>
		The following are the functions of the <bdi>umbilical code</bdi>
		<ul>
			<li>It facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The Oxygen moves from the mother to the embryo while carbon dioxide moves from the embryo to the placenta.</li>
			<li>it allows food nutrients to pass from the mother to the foetus.</li>
			<li>It also allows the transfer of watse materials from the foetus to the mother.</li>
			<li>It therefore joins the foetus to the mother.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<h4 id="A6">Functions of the placenta</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Food nutrients are obtained by the foetus through the placenta.</li>
			<li>It allows movement of waste material from the foetus to the mother's blood system.</li>
			<li>It connects the foetus through the umbilical cord, to the mother.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		

<h4>Functions of the amniotic fluid</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>It keeps the foetus warm and moist</li>
			<li>It protects the foetus from injuries by acting as a shock absorber.</li>
			<li>It allows the foetus to move freely.</li>
			<li>It lubricates the birth canal during parturition(birth)</li>
			
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Signs of pregnancy</h4>

<p>
The period between fertilisation and birth is known as the <bdi>gestation period</bdi>. During this period, the following may occur.
	<ul>
			<li>The woman cannot experience menstruation.</li>
			<li>The breats become bigger, tender and sensitive.</li>
			<li>The woman experiences nausea commonly referred to as morning sickness.</li>
			<li>The abdomen becomes enlarged.</li>
			<li>Some movements in the abdomen may be felt.</li>
			<li>The skin complexion changes</li>
			
	</ul>
</p>

<h4 id="A9">The process of giving birth</h4>

<p>
	<ul>
			<li>The baby is ready to be born after 9 months or 40 weeks.</li>
			<li>The baby is in position with the head facing the birth canal</li>
			<li>Labour pains caused by contraction of the uterine wall muscles begin</li>
			<li>The cervix dialates</li>
			<li>The amniotic sac bursts and the amniotic fluid comes out.</li>
			<li>The baby comes out with the head first.</li>
			<li>The umbilical cord is normally tied at two points, one closer to the baby, and cut to separate the mother from the child.</li>
			<li>The tying of the umbilical cord prevents excess bleeding.</li>
			<li>Continued contraction of the uterine walls removes afterbirth that consists of the placenta, umbilical cord and the amnion sac.</li>
			<li>The equipment used during parturition should be sterile and birth attendants should wear protective clothing.</li>
